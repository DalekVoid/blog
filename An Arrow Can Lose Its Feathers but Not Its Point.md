# An Arrow Can Lose Its Feathers but Not Its Point
This is not a proverb, as you might think at first sight. It is simply an observation about a common directional signal that in recent years has lost almost everything, but kept its most essential part.

If there is an object known to everyone, even to savages, and one that can be used to indicate direction, that object is the arrow. The arrow leaves a taut bow and always flies in the direction of its point.

Whoever chose the arrow as a signal to indicate direction must evidently have thought of this. And of course, for this purpose, it doesn't matter if the arrow is made of ebony, teak or a willow wand, if the arrowhead is made of forged iron or tiger's bone, or whether the flight that keeps it on a straight course is made of feathers endowed with magic powers to guide it to its mark. What matters is the shape.

At the beginning of the nineteenth century, arrows used as signs had scarcely begun to be stylized. The part representing the feathered flight was simply filled in with black, with straight lines at top and bottom and curved lines at front and back to suggest the softness of the feathers. 'Otherwise,' some critic of the times is sure to have said, “no one will understand what it is.” Later the arrow became more rigid, and the point sharper, as we find on the roadsigns of _circa_ 1910.

We will not go into all the byways of this development, but stick to the main road. The arrow loses its slender shaft, the breadth of the flight being continued down the whole length until it meets the head. Certainly it is more noticeable like this. One could even do away with the indented notch at the heel of the arrow. And indeed, it was done away with. By now it was realized that all one's attention should be concentrated on the point of the arrow, for that is the part that actually conveys the message. The rest could be eliminated. The shape arrived as is still seen on the traffic signals that tell you which way to turn: a white arrow on a blue background.

Early in the twentieth century, with Futurism and the first experiments in geometric design, the arrow grew thicker still. This time it was the width of the arrowhead that determined the thickness of the shaft. The arrow became a rectangle with a triangle cut out of the heel and stuck on the front instead. The cut-out at the back suggests that the designer was uncertain of getting his message across clearly with this sign, for the triangular cut-out represents the shape of the feathered flight, long since done away with. We still find this model of the arrow on our roads, where it is used to mark dangerous bends.

But soon the heel of the arrow was cut straight across, and the last suggestion of the flight vanished. And so it remains, an oblong with a point at one end.

Now we have become so highly trained, and our reflexes are so fast, that the arrow has even lost all trace of its shaft. After all, what matters is the point, and the point remains in the shape of the black triangle we often see at the bottom righthand corner of magazine pages, indicating that the article we are reading is continued on the following pages.

But the arrow has not yet finished its process of transformation. The most recent signs accompanying the names of towns along the Italian motorways have just the leading edge of the arrowhead, as in the last of my illustrations. Every now and then some artistically nostalgic draughtsman puts in an old-fashioned arrow, but is at once overwhelmed by an army of points, just the extreme essential tips of arrowheads that we take in in the blinking of an eye, almost without noticing them.
