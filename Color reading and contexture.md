# Color reading and contexture
The concept that "the simpler the form of a letter the simpler its reading” was an obsession of beginning constructivism. It became something like a dogma, and is still followed by "modernistic” typographers.

This notion has proved to be wrong, because in reading we do not read letters but words, words as a whole, as a “word picture.”  
This was discovered in psychology, particularly in Gestalt psychology.  
Ophthalmology has disclosed that the more the letters are differentiated from each other, the easier is the reading.

Without going into comparisons and details, it should be realized that words consisting of only capital letters present the most difficult reading—because of their equal height, equal volume, and, with most, their equal width.  
When comparing serif letters with sans-serif, the latter provide an uneasy reading.  
The fashionable preference for sans-serif in text shows neither historical nor practical competence.

First, sans-serifs were designed as letters not for texts but for captions,  
when pictorial reproductions were introduced with stone lithography.  
Second, they produce poor “word pictures.”

This illustrates that clear reading depends upon the recognition of context.

In musical compositions,  
so long as we hear merely single tones, we do not hear music.  
Hearing music depends on the recognition of the in-between of the tones,  
of their placing and of their spacing.

In writing, a knowledge of spelling has nothing to do with an understanding of poetry.

Equally, a factual identification of colors within a given painting  
has nothing to do with a sensitive seeing  
nor with an understanding of the color action within the painting.

Our study of color differs fundamentally from a study which anatomically dissects colorants (pigments) and physical qualities (wave length).

Our concern is the interaction of color; that is, seeing  
what happens between colors.

We are able to hear a single tone.  
But we almost never (that is, without special devices) see a single color unconnected and unrelated to other colors.  
Colors present themselves in continuous flux, constantly related to changing neighbors and changing conditions.

As a consequence, this proves for the reading of color  
what Kandinsky often demanded for the reading of art:  
what counts is not the what but the how.
